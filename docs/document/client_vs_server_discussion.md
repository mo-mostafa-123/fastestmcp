# Should `client/client.py` Be a Server? (Discussion)

## Context
- `client/client.py` in this project is a high-level wrapper around the FastMCP client, providing modular access to tools, resources, prompts, notifications, logging, elicitation, and discovery.
- It is not a server; it is a client-side orchestrator meant to be used by applications, scripts, or agent frameworks to interact with an MCP server.

## Typical Usage Patterns (VS Code & Python Ecosystem)
- In most VS Code extensions and Python projects, a `client.py` file is used for client logic: connecting to servers, making API calls, and managing local state.
- A `server.py` file is used for server logic: handling incoming requests, exposing endpoints, and managing server-side state.
- The separation is clear: `client.py` is not a server, and should not expose server endpoints or run as a service.

## Why Not Make `client.py` a Server?
- **Responsibility:** The client is responsible for consuming APIs, not exposing them.
- **Security:** Running client code as a server can introduce unnecessary attack surfaces.
- **Clarity:** Keeping client and server logic separate makes the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
- **Extensibility:** If you need a server, create a dedicated `server.py` (as in this project) and keep `client.py` focused on orchestration and API consumption.

## How Most Projects Handle This (VS Code & Python)
- **VS Code Extensions:**
  - The extension host (client) communicates with a language server (server) via LSP or custom protocol.
  - The client is never a server; it is always the consumer.
- **Python Projects:**
  - `client.py` is used for API clients, SDKs, or orchestrators.
  - `server.py` is used for FastAPI, Flask, or custom servers.
  - The two are kept separate for clarity and maintainability.

## Conclusion
- `client/client.py` should remain a client, not a server.
- If you need to expose server-side logic, use a dedicated `server.py`.
- This separation is the norm in both VS Code and Python ecosystems, and is recommended for clarity, security, and extensibility.
